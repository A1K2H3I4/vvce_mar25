IMPORTANT GIT COMMANDS

$ git status
// To know the current status of our Repo

$ git clone <URL>
// To download a Repo

git clone https://github.com/neelmyna/vvce_mar25
// Example to download the repo

$ git pull origin main
// Command to download the updated Repo from the server to the local machine

To make our computer recognise our git account, we must run these 2 conguration commands:

$ git config --global user.name "neelmyna"

$ git config --global user.email "nithin@gmail.com"

STEPS TO CREATE A NEW PAT IN GITHUB:

Login to github
Right top corner Click on your profile
Scroll down and click settings
Next window, scroll down, on left bottom corner, click developer settings
Next window, on top left, Click personal access tokens, Click again on token Classic
Next window, Click on Generate new token button and select Tokens classic
(Now u may be asked to enter password)
Next, Add a note for the new PAT we are creating
Select Expiry -> No expiration
Select the Top check box named REPO
Scroll down fully and click the green button (generate token)
Now, copy the PAT
Come to your gmail and mail the PAT to yourself or to one of your own account (Mail Subject: GIT PAT)

Now, let us Sync our Remote Repo with Local Repo
In other words, we are going to CLONE our Repo using the PAT.
By doing so, we can perform Read-Write operations on our Remote Repo without having to Authenticate everytime.

$ git clone https://<PAT>@github.com/neelmyna/vvce_mar25

Commands required to upload files from local repo to remote:

$ git add .
// Git will mark(stage) all the files that need to be updated

$ git commit -m "notes file of the mtd training is added"
// Git creates an object that will inlclude all the files to be uploaded and also it is secured (encription)

$ git push origin main
// the object now is sent to the server (the remote repo is updated)

// Accept a number from the user and check if it is Even.
#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
    int inutNum = 0;
    puts("Enter a number to check if it is Even");
    scanf("%d", &inutNum);
    if(inutNum % 2 == 0)
        printf("%d is Even", inutNum);
    

}
---------------------------------
// Accept a number from the user and check if it is Even or not
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int inutNum = 0;
    puts("Enter a number to check if it is Even");
    int returnValue = scanf("%d", &inutNum);
    if (inutNum % 2 == 0)
        printf("%d is Even number", inutNum);
    else
        printf("%d is not an Even number", inutNum);
    return 0;

f f  = 240 + 15 = 255

-1*2(7) + 1*2(6) + 1*2(5) + 11
-128 + 64 + 32 + 11
-64 + 43
-21

by default all numbers are signed

int num;
signed int num;
--------------------------
TYPE CASTING

float num = 11 / 3;
printf("%f", num);

int num = 11 / 3.0;
printf("%d", num);

11 to 11.0 (int to double) implicit up cast
we get 3.666667
3.666667 is converted to int (from double to int)
implicit down cast

int num = (int) 11.5f / 2.0;
printf("%d", num);

11.5f to 11 (float to int) explicit down cast
11 / 2.0
11 to 11.0 (int to double) implicit up cast
11.0 / 2.0
5.5
5.5 to 5 (double to int) implicit down cast
------------------------------------
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int i = -1;
    i -= -1;
    printf("%d", i);
    return 0;
}
